# Auto Scheduler
This scheduler was intenteded to schedule CDA shifts automatically for IIT-RGL.
The main goal is to allow a supervisor to set a schedule on a calendar and set a date range where it is valid.
The information needed from the supervisor are
    - The date range where the schedule will be valid for
    - Shift Times
    - Repeating weekly hours. 
    - Employee email addresss
    - Deadline by which the schedules should be submitted 
After the supervisor fills this information out, a spreadsheet will be populated by the information collected. The employees will recieve an email prompting them to open and fill out a form.
The employees will need to provide:
    - How many hours a week they are willing to work for
    - Their daily preferences for working
    - Any expections for specific days which they do not wish to work for.
After initial responses are recieved the supervisor will have the option to run a process which will automatically populate a weekly spreadsheet from the responses recieved.
